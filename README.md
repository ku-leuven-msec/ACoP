# ACoP

In the present digital world, we depend on information technology more than ever. Our economy, health, well-being and even our lives depend on it. In this world, information security is a basic requirement, with access control playing a key role in limiting potential risks associated with data exposure. Logic has shown to be very useful in access control.  It has been used to formally explain or verify access control policies, to express or even enforce them. Here, logic is employed as a reasoning service in support of other systems. However, a general access control mechanism for logic programs is not available. 

This work presents ACoP, a structural approach that brings Access Control to Logic Programming. It allows to constrain access to the knowledge base.
The solution supports fine-grained access control using both deny and allow list strategies.
Overhead is limited to defining access rules. The flexibility in expressing these rules allows to realize different access control mechanisms including role based, relationship based and attribute based access control. A Prolog prototype validates the presented approach.
